in short:
these are the sha3-512 hashes of debian-amd64-stable-securities apt repo taken with apt-mirror on 2018-05-03:
(apt-sha_2018-05-03.7z, 13Mb, sha512=63972bc2741729dbf1a22ab0b0f2c386601b9553a2318c8b4327c9662f86e7a8a257c1317bf9928a4e12f026c4d9d bb42494b69f86d2685131a4f59525a53c1f )


long version:
I've created a apt-mirror (68.3Gb) using this:

 deb http://ftp.at.debian.org/debian/ stable main contrib non-free
 deb http://security.debian.org/ stable/updates main contrib non-free

on 2018-05-03.
and calculated sha3-512 hashes of all executables inside .deb files ( well hopefully all, they were identified using 'if file "$f" | grep -q ": ELF "'... )

NOTE: the filename like, for eg., "libj.sha3" mean the hashes inside are of files that belong to .deb packages starting with libj.
IT IS NOT THE start of executable filename!!

in short:
these are the sha3-512 hashes of debian-amd64-stable-securities apt repo taken with apt-mirror on 2018-05-03:
(apt-sha_2018-05-03.7z, 13Mb, sha512=63972bc2741729dbf1a22ab0b0f2c386601b9553a2318c8b4327c9662f86e7a8a257c1317bf9928a4e12f026c4d9d bb42494b69f86d2685131a4f59525a53c1f )


long version:
I've created a apt-mirror (68.3Gb) using this:

 deb http://ftp.at.debian.org/debian/ stable main contrib non-free
 deb http://security.debian.org/ stable/updates main contrib non-free

on 2018-05-03.
and calculated sha3-512 hashes of all executables inside .deb files ( well hopefully all, they were identified using 'if file "$f" | grep -q ": ELF "'... )

NOTE: the filename like, for eg., "libj.sha3" mean the hashes inside are of files that belong to .deb packages starting with libj.
IT IS NOT THE start of executable filename!!

the 'database' is currently in CSV format, like this: hash,filesize[bytes],filename
example:

..



use the elfchk.sh to check the hash
